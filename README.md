# Air Pollution Analysis and Forecasting

This repository contains three separate Google Earth Engine (GEE) scripts for analyzing air pollution, modeling pollutant dispersion, and forecasting spatial patterns using satellite data.

## Structure
- `Program_1`: Data retrieval and preprocessing for Sentinel-5P datasets.
- `Program_2`: Machine learning-based pollutant dispersion modeling using Random Forest.
- `Program_3`: Air pollution forecasting using exponential smoothing.

## Usage
1. Copy the content of each `main.js` to Google Earth Engine (https://code.earthengine.google.com/).
2. Modify the parameters such as AOI and date range according to your requirements.
3. Run the script to generate outputs.

For further details, refer to comments in the code.
